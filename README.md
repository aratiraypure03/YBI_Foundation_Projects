𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝟭: 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝘄𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗻 𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

𝗢𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲:

To develop a classification model to predict handwritten digits using the digits dataset. The dataset consists of 8x8 grayscale pixel images representing digits (0-9).

𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘁:

The dataset contains 1,797 samples of handwritten digits.

Each image is an 8x8 matrix of pixel intensities.


𝗧𝗮𝘀𝗸𝘀:

1. Data Visualization: Displayed sample digit images with their labels.


2. Data Preprocessing: Flattened the image matrices into 1D feature vectors.


3. Model Training:

Applied supervised machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification.

Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices.




𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗟𝗶𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀:

Python libraries: Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝟮: 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸 𝗖𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿 𝗖𝗵𝘂𝗿𝗻 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

𝗢𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲:

To predict customer churn for a bank using machine learning, identifying key factors contributing to customer retention.

Dataset:

A dataset with 10,000 entries and 13 features, including customer demographics, account details, and churn status.


𝗧𝗮𝘀𝗸𝘀:

1. Data Preprocessing:

Encoded categorical features (e.g., geography and gender) into numerical formats.

Applied feature scaling to standardize data.

Addressed class imbalance using Random Over Sampling and Under Sampling techniques.



2. Model Training:

Trained an SVM classifier to predict customer churn.

Performed hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search for optimal model parameters.



3. Evaluation:

Used metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.
